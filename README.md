## 📌 What Is This?

Urban expansion reshapes land surfaces in ways that directly drive climate risk — intensifying heat islands, increasing flood vulnerability, and altering carbon balance. Mapping built-up areas accurately and at scale is foundational to climate-informed urban planning.

This project builds a **reproducible deep learning pipeline** that extracts built-up areas from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery using a **multi-spectral UNet segmentation model** — trained on Chennai and applicable to any Indian city.

It goes beyond traditional ML classifiers by applying convolutional neural networks to learn spatial patterns directly from satellite image patches, achieving pixel-level segmentation at 10m resolution.

---

## 🎯 Scientific Objective

To learn pixel-level representations of built-up surfaces from multi-spectral Sentinel-2 imagery, enriched with urban-discriminative spectral indices, using deep convolutional semantic segmentation.

## 🛰️ Input Data

**Sentinel-2 Level-2A bands:**

| Band | Name | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| B02 | Blue | 10m |
| B03 | Green | 10m |
| B04 | Red | 10m |
| B08 | Near Infrared | 10m |
| B11 | Shortwave Infrared | 20m (resampled to 10m) |

**Spectral indices computed:**

| Index | Purpose |
|---|---|
| NDVI | Vegetation contrast (inverse signal for built-up) |
| NDBI | Built-up surface indicator |
| NDWI | Water body detection |
| BSI | Bare soil detection |
| IBI | Integrated Built-up Index |

**Final model input:** 10-channel feature stack `[B02, B03, B04, B08, B11, NDVI, NDBI, NDWI, BSI, IBI]`

---

## 🤖 Model Architecture

**UNet Semantic Segmentation**
- Encoder-decoder structure with skip connections
- 10-channel multi-spectral input
- Pixel-level binary classification output (built-up / non built-up)
- Chosen for strong spatial segmentation performance on remote sensing data

**Loss Function:**
```
Loss = Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) + Dice Loss
```
BCE handles pixel-wise accuracy; Dice Loss handles region-level spatial overlap.

---

## 📈 Performance

**Primary metric: Intersection over Union (IoU)**

```
IoU = TP / (TP + FP + FN)
```

| IoU Range | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| < 0.40 | Weak |
| 0.40 – 0.59 | Moderate |
| 0.60 – 0.70 | Strong |
| > 0.70 | Research-grade |

✅ **Observed validation IoU ≈ 0.60+** at Sentinel-2 10m resolution over Chennai.
